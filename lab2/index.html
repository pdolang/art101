			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The assignment requested us to create a website using HTML with the heading "Hello World" and a paragraph about our partner.
						Then, we used CSS to change the color, layout, and style of the website. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was unsure on how to center my image to align it with my text paragraph and my heading. I tried using the same coding method 
						to make the image consistently center so it is not dependent on how large your website window is. I ended up googling my question
						and found the solution by clicking the first link from FreeCodeCamp since my partner also wasn't sure of how to fix my problem.
						I tested the code and it worked! It was really bugging me that the image wasn't centered so I am glad I figured it out. 
						I also credited FreeCodeCamp, along with the specific website I found the solution on.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went smoothly, surprisingly. I thought it would be a bit more complex, even when I faced some complications with my code. 
						I was able to efficiently problem-solve and it worked out way better than I expected. I am definitely proud of myself and the work I was 
						able to produce!
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We successfully made a functional and aesthetically pleasing website that included all the requirements for this assignment.</p>
