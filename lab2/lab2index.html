            <p>My partner is super cool and likes cheese. I like cheese even though I am lactose intolerant. 
            My partner and I both crochet and we are third-year art students! We also have dyed hair and we love cats.
            Corey and I do not have any coding experience so using HTML and CSS for the first time is quite a learning experience.
            With the information we will learn in this class, we hope to create websites to showcase our artwork.
