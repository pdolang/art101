			<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we had to create a JavaScript file that asks for user input of their name,
                        or whatever characters they inputted. With this input, we created an array by splitting up each 
                        individual character. Then, we sorted through the array with an alphabetical organizational method.
                        Finally, we created a string that combined all the sorted characters of the array and neatly printed out 
                        the string for the user to see their "new name."
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For this lab, I was quite confused on how functions worked at the beginning. I didn't understand
                        how to utilize each function to end up creating the results I wanted. Through lecture and section,
                        I was able to clear up all my questions and ended up creating a working JavaScript file in my website!
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab made me realize how there is a great range of things you can do with JavaScript. </p>
