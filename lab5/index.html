			<h1>Lab 5: Data Types & Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were assigned to work in the JavaScript console and practice using variables.
						After playing around in the Javascript console, we transferred our variables and data into 
						a JavaScript file in our code editor, VS Code. Within VS Code, we were asked to print out the 
						variables which consisted of descriptors about a car. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not encounter many problems. At first, my script would not produce the output I wanted but 
						it turns out I didn't copy & paste the file into my index.html file correctly. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was quite straightforward and easy. I thought it was a great intro level assignment for 
						people that have never coded before. Considering I don't have any JavaScript experience, I am 
						proud of my results.
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The output of my JavaScript code should be printed in the section below.</p>
