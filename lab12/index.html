			<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were assigned to experiment with JavaScript conditional statements such as if, else, and 
                        if else statements. With this prompt, we used the Sorting Hat concept from Harry Potter to experiment with these 
                        new concepts. By inputting your name in the section below titled "Welcome to Hogwarts," you will receieve a message 
                        including your Sorting Hat results. 
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems understanding the logic behind if else statements, especially since I had difficulty understanding 
                        this concept when I was learning Python. Through class lectures and the Google slides, I was able to get more 
                        comfortable with working with conditional statements. 
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I am proud of the work I was able to produce with JavaScript and I exceed my personal expectations every time!</p>
