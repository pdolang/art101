        <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
        <p>For this lab, we were assigned to create an organized file structure for ART101. We created
            a file system organizing the HTML, CSS, and JS files within their designated assignment folders 
            which are all within one folder for the class.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>The lab seemed confusing at first since there were multiple different file types
            we had to organize, however, I got the hang of it quickly once I understood what we needed 
            to do.</p>
