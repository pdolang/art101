			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure & File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were assigned to create an organized file structure for ART101. We created
						a file system organizing the HTML, CSS, and JS files within their designated assignment folders 
						which are all within one folder for the class.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The lab seemed confusing at first since there were multiple different file types
						we had to organize, however, we got the hang of it quickly once we understood what we needed 
						to do.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was intimidating at first but once you understand how to do it, it wasn't so bad.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We made a webpage displaying the file structure of our labs which include HTML, CSS, and JS files
						& individual folders.
					</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
