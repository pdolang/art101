			<h1>Lab 6: Arrays & Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to get us familiar with using arrays and objects in our 
						JavaScript Code. We used the JavaScript console to create an array about the methods of 
						transportation we use and we also created an object about the car we described in Lab 5.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>In the JavaScript console, the object - myMainRide did not print out as intended. I saw on
						the Canvas Page for Lab 6 a trick to output all the contents of the object and it solved my
						problem. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment made me more comfortable working with JavaScript and attending in-person lectures
						definitely help with my understanding of the material. 
					</p>
