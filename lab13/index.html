			<h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were assigned to experiment with loops in JavaScript which included for loops and while loops. 
                        We ended up creating multiple input fields that tested to see the multiples of any inputted number and how many 
                        multiples there are depending on the inputted range. 
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems implementing jQuery into my JavaScript because I did not remember the proper syntax. I also 
                        had difficulty with the CSS styling for creating the columns of the output, however, I Googled both of these problems 
                        I had and then used the code from Google to fix my code. Obviously, still giving credit to the resources I used to 
                        accomplish this lab. 
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I am very proud of my results for this lab and I especially love how I was able to create columns for the output 
                        because I think it makes the results look much neater. 
                    </p>
