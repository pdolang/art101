			<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions & Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this assignment, we were asked to create an array of numbers
                        and assign it to a variable. Then, we created a function that will
                        do a simple calculation. Using this function, we used map() to callback 
                        our calculation. Then, we used an anonymous function as a callback with map() 
                        to do another calculation. After testing this out in the JavaScript console, 
                        we transferred our code into Visual Studio Code.
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had many problems trying to do one of the bonus tasks which was to 
                        print the results of our new arrays after our calculation functions.
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was a bit challenging and hard to grasp but I eventually 
                        understood the logic behind functions and callbacks.
                    </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The output of this assignment is implemented in the section below and can be 
                        seen through the JavaScript console!
