// Everyday Task - Making an Acrylic Cat Painting

// 1. Gather your materials - paints, paint brushes, cup of water, towels, etc
// 2. Prep your painting surface (canvas, paper, etc) by priming with white gesso 
// 3. After the gesso has dried, mix a color that will be the undertone of your painting - this is for 
// uniformity to create a color scheme guideline for your painting 
// 4. Mix the color with water to dilute it and create a wash on your painting surface 
// 5. Using your brush and color of your choice - make light and soft brush strokes to begin building the shape of your cat
// 6. Mixing colors as needed - begin blocking in generalized shapes to start filling in the cat and other objects you may 
// want to include
// 7. After creating your desired cat shape - mix a darker shade of the cat’s body color and begin blocking in shadows to 
// create a sense of depth and volume 
// 8. Mix a lighter shade of the cat’s body color and begin blocking in the highlights to create a solidified light source to 
// further accentuate the cat’s depth and volume
// 9. Once you have your basic shadows and highlights (using whatever technique of painting you desire), use a smaller brush 
// (or dry ish brush) to create fur-like strokes and give the illusion of the cat having fur (unless its hairless …) 
// 10. After adding all details you deem necessary, allow paint to fully dry
// 11. Bonus Step - you can seal your painting by adding a varnish (any finish) with a large brush on top once it is fully dry
