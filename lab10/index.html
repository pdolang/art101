			<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were asked to create a random message generator that looked similar to Loren Ipsum. 
						Using functions, unchangable variables, and methods, we were able to create a button that continuously produces 
						text bubbles of Latin gibberish. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled with having my code working for the lab. I couldn't understand why my random texts were only appearing
						in the console and not on the actual website page, however, I realized I did the silly mistake of not typing code in CSS 
						with the code for having the random texts show up. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was very impressed that I was able to create a random text generator with JavaScript. I also should remember to triple 
						check my work incase I missed something crucial.
					</p>
