					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were asked to experiment with different APIs and JSON. We had to link an API of our choice and 
                        experiment with grabbing data and printing the data from it. 
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had problems displaying my dog pictures. After creating an empty source in HTML and attributing the source with 
                        the image pulled in JavaScript, it ended up working. Then, I used CSS to make sure the picture wasn't too big.
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I didn't know you were able to pull data from APIs like this and it makes me want to experiment with others!</p>
			</div>
