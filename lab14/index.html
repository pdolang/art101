			<h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were asked to debug any of the previous labs that we had difficulties with. We 
                        experimented with the "debugger" tool in JavaScript to create breakpoints in our code.
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Funnily, a problem I had with this lab was understanding how to fix the problems in my Lab 13. When 
                        I would resubmit the values into my input fields, the output wouldn't be replace, it would simply be added onto 
                        the previous inputted values. 
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this lab was very simple, yet effective since it taught us how to properly debug our code.</p>
