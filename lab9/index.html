			<h1>Lab 9: Libraries & jQuery</h1>
			<div class="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were assigned to create a JavaScript file in Visual Studio Code with jQuery. 
                        Within this webpage, we were asked to create a button with a text label for each section of this 
                        lab index.html file. Using jQuery, we created a click event for each button. For this webpage, I changed
						the color of each section whenever the user clicked the button. Clicking the button back will reverse the color
						back to the original. 
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div class="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a lot of difficulties differentiating which button belonged to each section. I also was very confused about 
						how JavaScript knew what to reference in both the CSS file and the HTML file. Thankfully, the in-class lecture 
						cleared up all my questions about it. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I had a lot of fun customizing each button and styling each section. Through this lab, I definitely understand the 
						relationships between JavaScript, HTML, and CSS much more. 
					</p>

			<div class="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results of this lab should be shown when you click any of the buttons shown on this webpage!</p>
