			<h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were assigned to use an API that gets data which consists of a comic's title, image, and 
						description/alternative text. Using the AJAX method in jQuery, we were able to display the comic, along with its text.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem I had with this lab was making sure the data retrieved from the API was printing on my page. After 
						doing a lot of research, I found a method where we store the data in variable and embed it into a string that
						includes some HTML code and we append it to our HTML file. This can be seen in my JavaScript file which is linked below.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this lab was pretty cool and I am very impressed with the lab results. Bittersweet knowing this is 
						the last lab of ART101.
