			<h1>Lab 11: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were asked to experiment with JavaScript Events and functions through a value through 
                        user input. By creating an input section where the user is able to type and submit through a text box and button, 
                        we take the data inputted and scramble the name through our JavaScript code. The final output is a scrambled version
                        of the user's input. 
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some difficulties experimenting and creating different types of user input, however, I am glad 
                        I was able to include a variety in this lab.
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab pushed my limits when it came to coding with JavaScript. I was glad to see how much I was 
                        able to accomplish with JavaScript!
                    </p>
